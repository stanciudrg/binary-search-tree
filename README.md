# binary-search-tree
A balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure that organizes and stores data in a sorted manner.

#### Time complexity

- Average (Theta) - Î˜(n log(n)) - loglinear complexity for access, search, insertion, and deletion
- Worst (Big O) - O(n) - linear complexity for access, search, insertion, and deletion

#### Space complexity

- Worst (Big O) - O(n) - linear complexity
